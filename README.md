### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

### What I learned

I used the project to get comfromtable with forms. A react framework "Formik" really helped me out.
Formik helps with form validation and errors, making it easier for me to operate.



### Useful resources

- [Formik Docs](https://formik.org/) - The documentation was so eay to understand
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - I used chatgpt in some aspect and it helped a lot
